## Design and build a site to organize many types of content

Alex wanted his website to be a central place to collect and organize his information and appearances that were scattered all around the web. To accomplish this, we needed to organize and style many different types of media including articles, podcasts, and tweets.

He wanted to build his communities on Twitter and Telegram, and was looking for a bold, colorful design that was mobile friendly, easy to navigate, and looked good when shared across social media.

## A Gatsby website with iframe and Twitter integrations

Alex wanted his website to be built with React. We decided Gatsby would be perfect in this use case due its excellent SEO capabilities. First we built a fixed sidebar that displays components on click. These components organized the information by type (Twitter announcements, podcasts, etc.)

Data is pulled from other websites using iframes, loading a Uniswapt module and important tweets directly in the website. JSON LD schema, Twitter cards, and open graph data provides rich results in search engines and on social media platforms.

## Final Result

The result is a bright theme with bold buttons and eye-catching gradients. The website is mobile responsive and keyboard navigable. It produces large summary cards when shared on social media.

The site provides ways to connect with Alex on several different social media sites, lets users buy the \$ALEX token, and links out to his articles and podcasts. This project was built in collaboration with [BigHappyTrees](https://bighappytrees.github.io/).
