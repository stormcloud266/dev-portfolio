## Build a dark themed, mobile responsive website

AABS wanted a redesign and rebuild their existing WordPress website. They were looking for a faster, more secure site that provided a better experience for mobile users.

They wanted a sophisticated dark theme with a bold call-to-action, a content overhaul that included a blog and local landing pages, analytics integration, and a way for both potential clients and applicants to get in touch.

## A multi-page website and blog built on a modern framework

I worked with AABS to map out the website's new architecture according to their content needs, providing a more intuitive and easily navigable experience for users.

Our model included several new content types such as services pages, local landing pages, and blog posts from which pages would be generated. A static site generator, Gatsby, was used in conjunction with Contentful CMS so the client could easily edit or add these pages.

I integrated separate contact forms for clients and applicants, and Google Analytics to keep track of website traffic.

## Final Result

The site features a bold, dark theme with high contrast call-to-action buttons that grab attention. Clients can add new blog posts and service pages easily from the content management system.

An improved experience for mobile users, accessibility, and on-page SEO were built into the website from the very beginning. Optimized, lazy-loaded images and the static site setup provide quicker page load speeds. The result is faster, safer website secured with https.
